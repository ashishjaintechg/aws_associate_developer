How to create aws account?
a. signup gmail account
 ashishjainaws1@gmail.com
b. signup aws account
 root user  : ashishjainaws1@gmail.com
 verify aws account my email link
we have to do following things after creating aws root account
1. Delete your root access keys : it's already deleted by aws.
2. Activate MFA on your root account
 We have to first download the authenticator app from play store
 mfa - multi factor authenticator, keeps generating new code. We have to give two generated mfa codes from mobile apps and give it in console after showing qr code.
i scanned qr code and got the code
3. Create individual IAM users
 admin user : awsadmin1
 Key : AKIA5S6AXXWTTCF2N5F3
 Secret access key/Password : 
4. Use groups to assign permissions
 EC2FullAccess
 S3FullAccess
5. Apply an IAM password policy
⦁ Minimum password length is 6 characters
⦁ Require at least one uppercase letter from Latin alphabet (A-Z)
⦁ Require at least one lowercase letter from Latin alphabet (a-Z)
⦁ Require at least one number
⦁ Require at least one non-alphanumeric character (!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|')
⦁ Password expires in 90 day(s)
⦁ Password expiration requires administrator reset
⦁ Allow users to change their own password
⦁ Remember last 5 password(s) and prevent reuse
Now we will use admin user :  awsadmin1 user for all aws work.
We never use root user for any operation on aws account.
We will see how to create other two users : Console User and CLI User with admin user in next session.
Thank you
