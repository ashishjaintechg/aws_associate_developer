Session 2 :
1. How to create iam user for console and cli, provide roles and access resources?
a. First we will create two customer managed policies and will assign later to users
a. S3 Access policy - S3AccessPolicyUserConsole (This policy will be used by console user for accessing s3.)
b. Ec2 Access policy - EC2AccessPolicyUserCLI(This policy will be used by CLI user for accessing EC2.)
b. Now we will create two different user and assign above created policies
a. User Console S3 Access : UserConsoleS3Access (Console User having S3 Access)
i. https://934022725031.signin.aws.amazo...​
b. User CLI Ec2Access : UserCliEC2Access (CLI User having EC2 Access)
c. Now we will login with different users and check the access provided in incognito mode.
a. Check UserConsoleS3Access :
i. We have not provided access to EC2 to this user that’s why it is giving error. “An error occurred fetching instance data: You are not authorized to perform this operation.”
ii. Now check S3 Access : We are able to create testbuckets11
b. UserCliEC2Access check
i. For checking user through CLI we need access key
1. AKIA5S6AXXWTS7QSZUXV
2. la8N0hqgMlEk4MKfpdv0a1lQJljYlyADcViwlD81
ii. For connecting through cli we need AWS CLI software installed
1. You can install it by python
a. Need python software installed – check python(I have already installed python 3.8 version, you can download exe and install it easily : https://www.python.org/downloads/wind...​)
i. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/lates...​
ii. pip3 install awscli (Run this command for installing it by python)
2. You can download it 64 bit exe file
a. I have downloaded exe. We have to execute exe and it will install aws cli automatically. Simple steps we have to follow.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/lates...​
iii. Python process works for both windows as well as Ubuntu machines
1. You have to install python first then run pip3 install awscli command for Ubuntu
iv. AWS cli version can be checked by aws --version command (aws-cli/1.16.308)
v. AWS CLI Commands
1. aws configure – for connecting from cli, this will ask access id & secret
2. aws ec2 describe-regions – for checking ec2 regions, it requires region but it has access to ec2.
3. aws s3 ls – for s3 it gave error An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the ListBuckets operation: Access Denied
vi. Let’s change the access from console and check the same commands.
1. Now user has S3 Access also : testbuckets11
d. Good practice : We generally create groups and then assign policies to group and then add users in group. Let’s check that once.
Task :
1. Create two policies – s3 & ec2
2. Create two groups – s3accessgroup & ec2accessgroup
3. Create two users and add them in different group and verify the associate permissions
4. Check executing following command in aws cli & set default region
a. aws ec2 help
b. Default region name [None]: us-west-2
5. Login with different access user
a. Through console
b. Through cli
